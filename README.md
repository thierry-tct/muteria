# MUTERIA (MUlti-Tools and criTERIA framework for automated software testing)
[https://github.com/muteria/muteria](https://github.com/muteria/muteria)

*Muteria* is a Software Analysis/Testing framework that integrate multiple tools. 
*Muteria* support tools from various programming languages which are supported by implementing a driver.

  Report Sample. ![sample](doc/imgs/report_summary.png?raw=true "Title")

*Muteria* can be used through:
- Its [API]()
- Commnad Line Interface (CLI)

## Suported Systems
*Muteria* is written in Python and thus can run on Windows, Linux or macOS.

## Installation
muteria requires Python 3.
1. Install Muteria by running: 
``` bash
pip install muteria
```
2. View the usage help:
```bash
muteria --help
```


## Usage
*Muteria* requires to have the underlying tools installed on the system.
### Usage example C (in Docker container)
A docker image, with preinstalled tools, can be used to run muteria on a sample C language program.
The installed tools are: [GNU GCov](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html), [KLEE](https://klee.github.io/), [Shadow](https://srg.doc.ic.ac.uk/projects/shadow/shadow.html), [Mart](https://github.com/thierry-tct/mart), [SEMu](https://github.com/thierry-tct/KLEE-SEMu).
1. Pull the docker image:
``` bash
docker pull thierrytct/cm
```
2. run the docker image in a container:
``` bash
docker run -it --rm thierrytct/cm bash
```

3. Download the example program:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/muteria/example_c.git 
```

3. Change into the example program directory:
```bash
cd example_c
```
4. run using the configuration file in ctrl/conf.py
```bash
muteria --config ctrl/conf.py --lang c run
```

### Usage example Python

Example of measuring coverage for a python program using [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/v4.5.x/#).
1. Install `coverage.py`:
``` bash
pip install coverage
```
2. Download the example program:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/muteria/example_python.git 
```
3. Change into the example program directory:
```bash
cd example_python
```
4. run using the configuration file in ctrl/conf.py
```bash
muteria --config ctrl/conf.py --lang python run
```

## Drivers development
### Testcase Tools Drivers
Details on writing drivers for testcase (test generation) tools can be found [here](doc/user_doc/testcase_tool_driver.md).
### Test Criteria Tools Drivers
Details on writing drivers for test criteria tools can be found [here](doc/user_doc/criterion_tool_driver.md).

## Current Limitation
- Interface difference between multiple versions of the same tool 

---
## Development
### Things to fix
- Ensure tools plugins do not leave the repo srcs or exes in an infected state. They must cleanup the changes made. Ensure that by cleaning for them at top level (when the driver's methods are called in the meta tools)
- Handle reporting test error in stats (first within meta test execution)
- Enable having no criterion set

- Complete and test the web UI.
- Choice of test level (unit, system, ...)
- Complete the documentation
- Augment the test suite
