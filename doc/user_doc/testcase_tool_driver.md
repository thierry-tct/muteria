# Writing drivers for testcase tools

The following steps must be followed to implement a new driver. The final driver may be pushed to the [muteria](https://github.com/muteria/muteria)'s github repository, to be used by others.

1. The driver's code must be located in the folder `muteria/drivers/testgeneration/tools_by_languages/<Language>/<Driver-Folder>`.

2. An `__init__.py` file must be created in the driver folder (`<Driver-Folder>`) and assign the driver's class name to either `StaticCriteriaTool` or `DynamicTestcaseTool` as following: `StaticCriteriaTool = <Driver-Class>` or `DynamicTestcaseTool = <Driver-Class>`. If the testcase tool uses existing tests to generate new tests, then assign the class name to `DynamicTestcaseTool` and `None` to `StaticTestcaseTool`, and vice versa.See for example the case of [KLEE](https://github.com/klee/klee)'s driver in `muteria/drivers/testgeneration/tools_by_languages/c/klee/__init__.py`

3. The driver's class must extend the class `BaseTestcaseTool`, located in `muteria/drivers/testgeneration/base_testcasetool.py`, and implement all the _abstract_ methods (see for example [KLEE](https://github.com/klee/klee)'s driver in `muteria/drivers/testgeneration/tools_by_languages/c/klee/klee.py`). The abstract methods that must be implemented are listed bellow.

---

``` Python
    @classmethod
    def installed(cls, custom_binary_dir=None)
```
This method checks whether the tool is installed. It returns a boolean representing whether the tool is installed (executable is accessible on the path) or not. `True` means that the tool is installed, else `False` is returned.

| Paramter | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `custom_binary_dir` | `string` | custom directory to look for the relevant executable files for the corresponding tool. None means that the file are on the _PATH_. |

---

``` Python
    def get_testcase_info_object(self)
```
This method returns the info object for all tests managed/generated by the tool. The info object for testcases is an object of the class `TestcasesInfoObject`, defined in the file `muteria/drivers/testgeneration/testcases_info.py`

``` Python
    def _prepare_executable (self, exe_path_map, env_vars, \
                                                        collect_output=False):
```
This method is called before every test execution. Put any setup here.

| Paramter | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `exe_path_map` | `dict` | map each repository file to the corresponding instrumented file intended location. |
| `env_vars` | `dict` | env vars that are set for the execution. |
| `collect_output` | `bool` | map each repository file to the corresponding instrumented file intended location. |

---

``` Python
    def restore_default_executable (self, exe_path_map, env_vars, \
                                                        collect_output=False):
```
This method is called after every test execution. Put any teardown here.

| Paramter | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `exe_path_map` | `dict` | map each repository file to the corresponding instrumented file intended location. |
| `env_vars` | `dict` | env vars that are set for the execution. |
| `collect_output` | `bool` | map each repository file to the corresponding instrumented file intended location. |

---

``` Python
    def _execute_a_test (self, testcase, exe_path_map, env_vars, \
                    callback_object=None, timeout=None, collect_output=None)
```
This method is called after every test execution. Put any teardown here.

| Paramter | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `testcase` | `string` | name of test case to execute. |
| `exe_path_map` | `dict` | map each repository file to the corresponding instrumented file intended location. |
| `env_vars` | `dict` | env vars that are set for the execution. |
| `callback_object` | `BaseCallbackObject` | instace of implementation of Callback object (defined in `muteria/repositoryandcode/callback_object.py`). This is particularly useful when the test execution is performed in the repository dir and called through `run_dev_test` of the Repository manager (see for instance `muteria/drivers/testgeneration/custom_dev_testcase/custom_dev_testcase.py`). |
| `timeout` | `float` | timeout for the test execution. |
| `collect_output` | `bool` | map each repository file to the corresponding instrumented file intended location. |

---

``` Python
    def _do_generate_tests (self, exe_path_map, code_builds_factory, \
                                        meta_criteria_tool_obj=None, \
                                        max_time=None)
```
This method generates the test cases by calling the underlying tool. For reference, see `muteria/drivers/testgeneration/tools_by_languages/c/klee/klee.py`)

| Paramter | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| `exe_path_map` | `dict` | map each repository file to the corresponding instrumented file intended location. |
| `code_builds_factory` | `CodeBuildsFactory` | Class that defines methods to handle repository tasks, such as building code, ... (see file `muteria/repositoryandcode/code_builds_factory.py`). |
| `meta_criteria_tool_obj` | `MetaCriteriaTool` | MetaCriteriaTool object that managing the criterion tool with intrumented code on which the test generation should be conducted (example mutants to target). The MetaCriteriaTool is defined in `muteria/drivers/criteria/meta_testcriteriatool.py` |
| `max_time` | `float` | timeout for the test generation. |
